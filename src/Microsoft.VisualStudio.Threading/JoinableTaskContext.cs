/// <summary>
/// A common context within which joinable tasks may be created and interact to avoid deadlocks.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// There are three rules that should be strictly followed when using or interacting
/// with JoinableTasks:
///  1. If a method has certain thread apartment requirements (STA or MTA) it must either:
///       a) Have an asynchronous signature, and asynchronously marshal to the appropriate
///          thread if it isn't originally invoked on a compatible thread.
///          The recommended way to switch to the main thread is:
///          <code>
///          await JoinableTaskFactory.SwitchToMainThreadAsync();
///          </code>
///       b) Have a synchronous signature, and throw an exception when called on the wrong thread.
///     In particular, no method is allowed to synchronously marshal work to another thread
///     (blocking while that work is done). Synchronous blocks in general are to be avoided
///     whenever possible.
///  2. When an implementation of an already-shipped public API must call asynchronous code
///     and block for its completion, it must do so by following this simple pattern:
///     <code>
///     JoinableTaskFactory.Run(async delegate {
///         await SomeOperationAsync(...);
///     });
///     </code>
///  3. If ever awaiting work that was started earlier, that work must be Joined.
///     For example, one service kicks off some asynchronous work that may later become
///     synchronously blocking:
///     <code>
///     JoinableTask longRunningAsyncWork = JoinableTaskFactory.RunAsync(async delegate {
///         await SomeOperationAsync(...);
///     });
///     </code>
///     Then later that async work becomes blocking:
///     <code>
///     longRunningAsyncWork.Join();
///     </code>
///     or perhaps:
///     <code>
///     await longRunningAsyncWork;
///     </code>
///     Note however that this extra step is not necessary when awaiting is done
///     immediately after kicking off an asynchronous operation.
