    /// <remarks>
    /// There are three rules that should be strictly followed when using or interacting
    /// with JoinableTasks:
    ///  1. If a method has certain thread apartment requirements (STA or MTA) it must either:
    ///       a) Have an asynchronous signature, and asynchronously marshal to the appropriate
    ///          thread if it isn't originally invoked on a compatible thread.
    ///          The recommended way to switch to the main thread is:
    ///          <code>
    ///          await JoinableTaskFactory.SwitchToMainThreadAsync();
    ///          </code>
    ///       b) Have a synchronous signature, and throw an exception when called on the wrong thread.
    ///     In particular, no method is allowed to synchronously marshal work to another thread
    ///     (blocking while that work is done). Synchronous blocks in general are to be avoided
    ///     whenever possible.
    ///  2. When an implementation of an already-shipped public API must call asynchronous code
    ///     and block for its completion, it must do so by following this simple pattern:
    ///     <code>
    ///     JoinableTaskFactory.Run(async delegate {
    ///         await SomeOperationAsync(...);
    ///     });
    ///     </code>
    ///  3. If ever awaiting work that was started earlier, that work must be Joined.
    ///     For example, one service kicks off some asynchronous work that may later become
    ///     synchronously blocking:
    ///     <code>
    ///     JoinableTask longRunningAsyncWork = JoinableTaskFactory.RunAsync(async delegate {
    ///         await SomeOperationAsync(...);
    ///     });
    ///     </code>
    ///     Then later that async work becomes blocking:
    ///     <code>
    ///     longRunningAsyncWork.Join();
    ///     </code>
    ///     or perhaps:
    ///     <code>
    ///     await longRunningAsyncWork;
    ///     </code>
    ///     Note however that this extra step is not necessary when awaiting is done
    ///     immediately after kicking off an asynchronous operation.
