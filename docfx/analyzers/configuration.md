# Analyzer Configuration

Configuration is provided by way of `AdditionalFiles`, which is an item type
that you may use to add files to your project that provide data for analyzers
such as this one.

The name of the file added to `AdditionalFiles` is significant as it determines
which analyzer(s) will read it. For each use case below, a filename is given that
provides the described data. In each case, a pattern of filenames apply. For example,
if the filename prescribed is `vs-threading.TopicA.txt`, that filename as well
as others that extend that filename are considered. For example, these would all be
read by the analyzer too:

1. vs-threading.TopicA.1.txt
1. vs-threading.TopicA.2.txt
1. vs-threading.TopicA.ABC.txt

These additional files may be provided by the project being built, or other NuGet
packages referenced by the project. A NuGet package that delivers an SDK or library
for example may provide an MSBuild file to be imported by the project that adds these
files.

Files need not have unique filenames. Multiple packages based in different directories may
all use `vs-threading.TopicA.txt` as the filename for their `AdditionalFiles` item.

These files may contain blank lines or comments that start with the `#` character.

## Methods that assert the main thread

Code may assert it is running on the main thread by calling a method that is designed
to throw an exception if called off the main thread. These methods are used by
various analyzers to ensure that single-threaded objects are only invoked on the main thread.
These methods are identified as described below:

**Filename:** `vs-threading.MainThreadAssertingMethods.txt`

**Line format:** `[Namespace.TypeName]::MethodName`

**Sample:** `[Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ThreadHelper]::ThrowIfNotOnUIThread`

## Methods that switch to the main thread

Code may switch to the main thread by awaiting a method that is designed
to switch the caller to the main thread if not already there. These methods are used by
various analyzers to ensure that single-threaded objects are only invoked on the main thread.
These methods are identified as described below:

**Filename:** `vs-threading.MainThreadSwitchingMethods.txt`

**Line format:** `[Namespace.TypeName]::MethodName`

**Sample:** `[Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading.JoinableTaskFactory]::SwitchToMainThreadAsync`

## Members that require the main thread

Types or members that are STA COM objects or otherwise require all invocations to occur on
the main thread of the application can be configured into these analyzers so that
static analysis can help ensure thread safety of the application.
These are identified as described below:

**Filename:** `vs-threading.MembersRequiringMainThread.txt`

**Line format:** `[Namespace.TypeName]` or `[Namespace.*]` or `[Namespace.TypeName]::MemberName`

**Sample:** `[Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.*]` or `[Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Package]::GetService`

Properties are specified by their name, not the name of their accessors.
For example, a property should be specified by `PropertyName`, not `get_PropertyName`.

## Legacy thread switching members

Prior to Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading, libraries provided additional ways to execute
code on the UI thread. These methods should be avoided, and code should update to using
`JoinableTaskFactory.SwitchToMainThreadAsync()` as the standard way to switch to the main
thread.

**Filename:** `vs-threading.LegacyThreadSwitchingMembers.txt`

**Line format:** `[Namespace.TypeName]::MethodName`

**Sample:** `[System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher]::Invoke`

## Methods to exclude from VSTHRD103 checks

The VSTHRD103 analyzer flags calls to synchronous methods where asynchronous equivalents exist,
when in an async context. Sometimes certain APIs have async versions but those async versions 
are significantly slower, less efficient, or simply not preferred. These methods can be 
excluded from VSTHRD103 analysis by specifying them in a configuration file.

**Filename:** `vs-threading.SyncMethodsToExcludeFromVSTHRD103.txt`

**Line format:** `[Namespace.TypeName]::MethodName`

**Sample:** `[System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader]::Read`
